# WesterosCraft SFX Changelog [Hal9007]

June 23, 2017 -------------------------------------------------------------

~ Reimplemented all sounds in resource pack by renaming 'sound' folder to 'sounds'

Mojang works in mysterious ways.

August 24, 2014 -------------------------------------------------------------

~ Added initial pass of SoundBlocks to bundle with the WesterosBlocks mod: - Tavern - Blacksmith - Stables - Windmill - Armory - Butcher - Carpenter - Dungeon - Sept - Rookery - Sewer - Cave Ambience - Jenny of Oldstones (experimental music block) - Iron Mine - Heart Tree - Docked Ship - Ship Sails - Market - Training Yard - Beehive - Flag Flapping - Rushing Water - Warning Bells - Portcullis (4-sec and 6-sec) - Night's Watch Hornblast (1,2, and 3)

The purpose of these blocks is to emulate sounds that come from a source point
and encompass a fairly small area. These add immersion to the RPG world by
allowing players to guess the purpose of any given building before entering.
Triggered sounds (such as warning bells or hornblasts) also add immersion
by allowing players to interact with a soundscape that everyone around can hear.

August 27, 2013 -------------------------------------------------------------
